            <p>They're parked there every day, outside the Engemann Student Health Center, waiting patiently for lunch hour. 
            <br>Hungry college students swarm and sit on the grass to eat, enjoying hearty (and affordable) bowls of rice and noodles in the sun.
            <br>But how many of these students actually know the stories behind each truck, and the people working for them?</p>

          <h2>Food-Truck Man</h2>
          <div id="t">
              <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                  <p>With its bright pink color and picturesque menu items, the Food-Truck Man gives USC students a taste of Asian fusion.</p>
                  <p>“We serve mostly Asian food and Korean barbeque, some Japanese food, and the rest of it is Chinese food,” the truck’s owner Zhe Wang said. “There’s about 400 to 500 Chinese students walking by here every day, so I guess it’s reasonable to have a Chinese food truck here.”</p>
                  <p>The truck first came to USC for hired catering events, but started permanently parking outside Engemann around two years ago.</p>
                  <p>“At first we started with doing some events, and then we saw a lot of traffic here, so we started parking here,” Wang said. “We see about 70 customers a day… Some people come twice a day even.”</p>
                  <p>Wang says the best-selling menu item at the truck is the scrambled eggs with shrimp, though most students choose to get multiple entrees –– a single large-plate item is $10, two is $11, and three is $13.</p>
                  <p>“It tastes good, and the price is reasonable,” Wang said. “I think our prices are slightly cheaper than the USC Village… All our food is less than $11 with tax included.”</p>
                  <p>Though the truck’s prices are superior to the restaurants in the village, Wang does not feel like he is in competition with the other food trucks on his street, which are similarly inexpensive.</p>
                  <p>“It’s not like we are doing much better than the rest of trucks, and it’s not like the rest of the trucks is doing better than us,” he said. “I think we all get about 50-70 customers every day.”</p>
                  <p>Wang starts working at 8 a.m. every day, and finishes serving food around 7 p.m. before washing dishes and cleaning up. While he loves serving USC students, he hopes the truck can expand to a full restaurant one day.</p>
                  <p>“[Trucks are] a much smaller investment, using to get started,” he said. “But if I got enough money to open a restaurant, I definitely would do that.”</p>

              <div class="column">
                <p>Zhuo Yu is a cashier at J.C. Food Court, or “the original Sichuan Taste” in its Chinese name. His family bought the truck three months ago, though the previous owners owned it for three years.</p>
                <p>“My dad was the chef in a Japanese restaurant, and he’s good at cooking,” Yu said. “He knows how to make it delicious, so that’s why he said, let’s go. It’s going well so far.”</p>
                <p>Yu says his dad finds it easier working at the truck than in a restaurant, because he can work for himself and have complete control over his own dishes. The two of them work Monday through Saturday for around ten hours per day. </p>
                <p>Working closely with his dad, Yu offers recommendations to every customer who approaches the truck.</p>
                <p>“I think we got good service right here. For every customer that comes, we talk to them and try to tell them how to order. If I didn’t tell you, you’d be missing out,” Yu said. “Plus we have a lot of items here. We cook everything every day, every morning. We make everything fresh.”</p>
                <p>Yu says the truck’s largest customer base is international students from China, and that the truck sees around 70-80 people per day. On regular weekdays, the truck tends to sell out of everything, because people order multiple items as part of a combo.</p>
                <p>Yu says that as a cashier, he enjoys being able to talk to everyone who comes by.</p>
                <p>“For some people it’s like being a friend. They come in the afternoon and take a chat with me,” Yu said. “They talk about school and funny things. Some people talk about a girlfriend and a boyfriend, and that’s pretty fun for me.”</p>
                <p>Yu says this allows him to develop a relationship with customers outside of just serving them food.</p>
                <p>“I think for me, I’m so friendly because I don’t have to do anything else, so I just talk and they just share with me when something happens to them,” Yu said. “They like to talk to us, almost everyone.”</p>

                  <p>The oldest of all the Chinese food trucks, El Taco Gourmet –– or in its Chinese name, Chongqing Taste –– has been serving USC students for almost four years now.</p>
                  <p>“Our customers are always from China,” said Xueying Li, who has worked at the truck for all four of its years. “We have very special Chinese food here — a Chong Qing favorite, kind of spicy chili.”</p>
                  <p>The truck’s best sellers are the fish with Chinese sauerkraut, and the spicy pickles with rice. Customers get two entrees with a serving of rice, and a free soup with every meal.</p> 
                  <p>“The meals are a good size because the kids are always hungry,” Li said.</p>
                  <p>The free soups take around four to five hours to make, the truck’s owner Jin Fu said. One of the secrets to having an authentic taste, she said, is that they use seasonings brought all the way from Chongqing, and pickle their vegetables and peppers themselves following traditional methods.</p>      
                  <p>The truck is constantly updating their menu, and keeps prices under $10 to accommodate to its college-aged customer base. Li estimates that the truck receives around 200 customers a day.</p>
                  <p>“We love serving young people,” Li said. “And at the night time, when we’re almost finished, we don’t have too much food left.”</p>
