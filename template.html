            <p>They're parked there every day, outside the Engemann Student Health Center, waiting patiently for lunch hour. 
            <br>Hungry college students swarm and sit on the grass to eat, enjoying hearty (and affordable) bowls of rice and noodles in the sun.
            <br>But how many of these students actually know the stories behind each truck, and the people working for them?</p>
            <p>My mother always told me that food is a labor of love. 
            <br>When somebody cooks for you, they are sharing a part of their identity with you. 
            <br>They are creating something with their hands for you to take in and derive happiness from.
            <br>What can we learn about a person, by eating their food?</p>

          <p>I went to the Oshkosh store today, but before I went, I called my Appleton store again. I said, "I know I gave you my number and everything, I’ve been looking for these two candles, I’m going to the Oshkosh store and if you guys have my two candles I will head over there."</p>            
          <p>I was amazed, she said, “guess what, we have 'em in!" I was like, "what? Please, please put one of each on hold, I bought two Peach Bellini’s a while ago – actually I bought three –  so, I was just gonna take these two Peach Bellini’s back and exchange them." And I thought, "oh my gosh that’s awesome," so I said “I’m gonna go to Oshkosh first, I’m gonna going ahead–“ cause I live in Neenah, I said “I’m gonna go to Oshkosh first and then I’m gonna head all the way to Appleton to get these two candles because I want ‘um and I know that once they get them in they're gonna be gone."  I said “Please hold a three wick Iced Ginger Bread and a three wick Winter Candy Apple.”</p>  
          <p>She said, “Will do.” Kay, everything’s fine.</p>

          <p>So let me backtrack. If you guys have been watching my videos you all know that I have been searching high and low ever since they had the candle sale, two for twenty candles at bath and body works.</p>
          <p>I have been searching for two scents: I have been searching for the Winter Candy Apple and the Ice Ginger Bread. This is the last day of the sale, Sunday. I have been calling my store in Appleton – Appleton in Wisconsin, I want everyone to know. This happened in Appleton. I have been calling my store every day for the past week, wanting these two scents. I want Winter Candy Apple and Ice Ginger Bread.</p>

          <p>They were supposed to come out, uh,  they were launching in the stores October 29th, so they were supposed to be out. I have been calling Green Bay, Appleton, Fon du Lac and the outlet in Oshkosh. All four stores don’t have them. That’s not what makes me mad. Ticked me off a little bit, but I thought, ehh, they'll eventually come in, no big whoop. So, I have to calm down because it gets really bad here.</p>
          <p>So I’ve been calling calling calling. They don’t have them. This morning, well actually yesterday, I called my Appleton store and I said " you know, I hate to bother you again, but I’m calling about these candles." And I said, “If I am harassing you or anything in any way please let me know because I can be quite persistent.” I said so if you want to take down my name and number, like, go ahead and do that so you guys can call me when you get them in." The Appleton store. I gave her my name and number hadn’t heard from her.</p>
